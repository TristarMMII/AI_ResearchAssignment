# AI_ResearchAssignment : Chess (kr-vs-kp)

## Abstract
This project explores the Chess (King-Rook vs. King-Pawn) data set, using pycaret to build and evaluate the classification of the data set. The data set, commonly called kr-vs-kp, contains 37 attributes in total, with 36 of them describing the board positions and one attribute that indicates whether the white king can win or not. The project goes through several steps to accomplish the goals of this project. These steps include setup, model comparison, model analysis, model comparison, model creation and tuning, and model evaluation. These processes set up the data for use, compare the performance of different models, tune the best performing model, and evaluate the final model. The results showed that the best performing model is the CatBoost Classifier with the highest accuracy of 0.99. The model also performed with a high AUC, recall, precision and F1 score.
